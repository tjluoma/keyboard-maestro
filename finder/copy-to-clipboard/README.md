Press ⌘ + ⇧ + C and the path to the currently selected file/folder in Finder will be copied to the clipboard, and a notification will be shown:

If Growl is running, Growl will be used, otherwise a standard OS X notification will be used.

(If Growl is running _and_ `growlnotify` is installed, it will be used to show the proper Finder icon too. It’s a little thing, but I like having the icons in my notification match the relevant app.)
